    <p>Palak Paneer is a classic North Indian dish known for its vibrant green color and rich, creamy texture. It consists of tender spinach leaves (palak) cooked with paneer (Indian cottage cheese) in a flavorful gravy made from onions, tomatoes, garlic, ginger, and a blend of spices such as cumin, coriander, turmeric, and garam masala. The spinach is typically blanched and pureed to create a smooth and velvety sauce that coats the cubes of paneer, infusing them with the earthy and aromatic flavors of the spinach and spices.</p>
