    <p>Veg Biryani is a fragrant and flavorful rice dish that originates from the Indian subcontinent. It's a beloved vegetarian variation of the traditional biryani, typically made with a mix of long-grain basmati rice, assorted vegetables such as potatoes, carrots, peas, and cauliflower, infused with aromatic spices like cumin, cardamom, cloves, and cinnamon. The dish is often garnished with fried onions, fresh herbs like cilantro and mint, and sometimes topped with fried cashews or almonds for added richness and texture. The layers of vegetables and rice are cooked together with a blend of yogurt and sometimes tomatoes, creating a harmonious blend of flavors and textures that make it a hearty and satisfying meal.</p>

    <h2>Cooking Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Rinse the basmati rice under cold water until the water runs clear. Soak the rice in water for 30 minutes, then drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat oil or ghee in a large pot over medium heat. Add the bay leaves, cinnamon stick, cloves, and cardamom pods. Saut√© for a minute until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Add the sliced onions and cook until they turn golden brown.</li>
        <li>Stir in the minced garlic and grated ginger, and cook for another 1-2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the chopped tomatoes and cook until they soften and form a thick paste.</li>
        <li>Mix in the diced vegetables, turmeric powder, red chili powder, garam masala, and salt. Cook for a few minutes until the vegetables are slightly tender.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, whisk the yogurt until smooth. Add the yogurt to the pot and mix well with the vegetable mixture.</li>
        <li>Add the soaked and drained rice to the pot, and gently mix to combine with the vegetable mixture.</li>
        <li>Pour in enough water (approximately 3 cups) to cover the rice and vegetables by about 1 inch. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to low, cover the pot, and simmer for about 15-20 minutes, or until the rice is cooked through and fluffy.</li>
        <li>Once cooked, remove the pot from heat and let it sit, covered, for 5-10 minutes. Then, fluff the biryani gently with a fork.</li>
        <li>Garnish the biryani with chopped cilantro leaves, and if desired, toasted cashews and raisins. Serve hot with raita or yogurt sauce.</li>
