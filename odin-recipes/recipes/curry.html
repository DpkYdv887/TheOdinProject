    <p>Indian chicken curry is a flavorful and aromatic dish that originates from the diverse culinary traditions of India. It typically consists of tender pieces of chicken cooked in a rich, spicy gravy made from a blend of aromatic spices such as cumin, coriander, turmeric, and garam masala. The curry base often includes ingredients like onions, tomatoes, garlic, and ginger, which are cooked down to create a thick and luscious sauce. Depending on the region and personal preferences, variations of Indian chicken curry can include additional ingredients such as yogurt, coconut milk, or cream to enhance the richness and creaminess of the dish.</p>

    <h2>Steps to prepare Indian Chicken Curry</h2>   
    <ol>
        <li>Marinate the Chicken (Optional): If desired, marinate the chicken pieces with a mixture of yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, and a pinch of salt for about 30 minutes to an hour. This step helps to tenderize the chicken and infuse it with flavor.</li> 
        <li>Prepare the Spice Paste: In a small bowl, mix together the ground spices - cumin, coriander, turmeric, chili powder, and garam masala - with a little water to form a smooth paste. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat Oil: Heat oil or ghee in a large, heavy-bottomed pot or skillet over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Sauté Aromatics: Add the chopped onions to the hot oil and sauté until they turn golden brown and caramelized. Then, add the minced garlic and ginger, and sauté for another 1-2 minutes until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Add Spice Paste: Add the spice paste to the pot and cook for a couple of minutes until the raw smell of the spices disappears and the oil starts to separate from the mixture.</li>
        <li>Cook Tomatoes: Stir in the chopped tomatoes and cook until they soften and break down, forming a thick gravy.</li>
        <li>Add Chicken: Add the marinated chicken pieces (if marinated) to the pot and coat them well with the spice mixture. Cook for a few minutes, stirring occasionally, until the chicken is lightly browned on all sides.</li>
        <li>Simmer: Reduce the heat to low, cover the pot, and let the chicken simmer in the gravy for about 20-25 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through and tender. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking and ensure even cooking.</li>
        <li>Adjust Seasoning: Taste the curry and adjust the seasoning with salt and additional spices if needed, according to your preference.</li>
        <li>Finish: If using, stir in the coconut milk or yogurt to add creaminess to the curry. Let it simmer for another few minutes, then remove from heat.</li>
        <li>Garnish and Serve: Garnish the chicken curry with chopped cilantro leaves and sliced green chilies for added flavor and freshness. Squeeze some fresh lemon juice over the top for a tangy kick. Serve hot with rice, naan bread, or roti.</li>
